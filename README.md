## Angular/CLI
This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli).

* It is designed to support Angular routing, with two sample routes defined plus a page not found (404) handler.
* I have turned on route tracking via Angular's ExtraOptions feature.
* A snippet of the relevant code is shown below:
## Developer Notes
* Note: to avoid error TS2322, I had to change the following from this:
    ```typescript
    [ngClass]="inactive-route"   [routerLink]="link.path"
    ```
    to this:
    ```typescript
    [ngClass]="'inactive-route'"   [routerLink]="link.path"
    ```
    Notice the extra single quotes inside the double quotes

    
## @angular/flex-layout DEPRECATION notes
* [Modern CSS in Angular: Layouts](https://blog.angular.io/modern-css-in-angular-layouts-4a259dca9127)
* [Flexbox with Angular demo](https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-cssflex?file=src/main.ts)
* [CSS Grid with Angular demo](https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-modern-cssgrid?file=src%2Fmain.ts)
## routes

```typescript
const routes: Routes = [
    {path: 'home', component: HomeComponent, title: 'Home'},
    {path: 'about', component: AboutComponent, title: 'About'},
    {path: '', redirectTo: 'home', pathMatch: 'full'},
    {path: '**', component: PageNotFoundComponent}
];
const routeOptions: ExtraOptions = {
    enableTracing: true
};

@NgModule({
    imports: [RouterModule.forRoot(routes, routeOptions)],
```

It is also designed to use SCSS for styling.


## Known Issues

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).
